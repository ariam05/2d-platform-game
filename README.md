# Willo 2d Platform Game

In this project, I developed an engaging 2D platformer game featuring a dynamic ghost character and a variety of challenging enemies. The game environment is rich with obstacles and platforms, creating an immersive experience for players.

Players navigate through the game as the main character, strategically dodging enemies and collecting valuable coin icons scattered throughout the game. These coins contribute to the player's score, incentivizing exploration and skillful maneuvering.

Players must be vigilant as they traverse the game world, as encounters with enemies result in health depletion. Each collision with an enemy deducts from the player's health, gradually diminishing their ability to progress.

Heart icons periodically appear in the game, replenishing the player's health and providing a lifeline amidst the challenges.

Leveraging the pygame library, I implemented efficient collision detection algorithms and responsive gameplay mechanics, ensuring a seamless and immersive gaming experience. Additionally, I integrated scoring systems and health management features to heighten player engagement and foster strategic decision-making.
